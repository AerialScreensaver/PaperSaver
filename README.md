## Requirements

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- Swift 6.2 or later
- Xcode 14.0 or later (for development)

## Installation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Development Version Only**  
> This package is not yet published to a stable release. You can only install the development version.

### Swift Package Manager

Add PaperSaver to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/AerialScreensaver/PaperSaver.git", branch: "main")
]
```

Or add it through Xcode:
1. File ‚Üí Add Package Dependencies...
2. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/AerialScreensaver/PaperSaver.git`
3. Select "Branch" and enter `main`
4. Click "Add Package"


## Usage

### Basic Example

```swift
import PaperSaver

// Initialize the manager
let paperSaver = PaperSaver()

// Set screensaver for main display
try await paperSaver.setScreensaver(module: "Aerial", for: .main)

// Get current configuration
if let screensaver = paperSaver.getActiveScreensaver(for: .main) {
    print("Current screensaver: \(screensaver.name)")
}
```

### Setting Screensaver Idle Time

```swift
// Set screensaver to activate after 5 minutes of inactivity
try paperSaver.setIdleTime(seconds: 300)
```

### Listing Available Screensavers

```swift
let availableScreensavers = paperSaver.listAvailableScreensavers()
for screensaver in availableScreensavers {
    print("\(screensaver.name): \(screensaver.identifier)")
}
```

## macOS Version Compatibility

PaperSaver automatically detects the macOS version and uses the appropriate method for managing screensavers and wallpapers:

- **macOS Sonoma (14.0) and later**: Uses the new per-screen/space configuration system via `com.apple.wallpaper`
- **Pre-Sonoma versions**: Falls back to traditional `com.apple.screensaver` preferences and NSWorkspace APIs

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AerialScreensaver/PaperSaver.git
cd PaperSaver
swift build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
swift test
```

### Using the CLI Tool

The project includes a command-line interface for testing and development:

```bash
# Build and run the CLI
swift run papersaver-cli --help

# List available screensavers
swift run papersaver-cli list

# List spaces (macOS Sonoma+)
swift run papersaver-cli list-spaces

# Set a screensaver
swift run papersaver-cli set Aerial
```

### Current Development Focus

- Improving wallpaper management functionality
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation and examples
