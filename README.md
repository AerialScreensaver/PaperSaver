## Installation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Development Version Only**  
> This package is not yet published to a stable release. You can only install the development version.

### Swift Package Manager

Add PaperSaver to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/AerialScreensaver/PaperSaver.git", branch: "main")
]
```

Or add it through Xcode:
1. File ‚Üí Add Package Dependencies...
2. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/AerialScreensaver/PaperSaver.git`
3. Select "Branch" and enter `main`
4. Click "Add Package"


## Usage

### Basic Example

```swift
import PaperSaverKit

// Example: Ensure Aerial screensaver is active system-wide
func ensureAerialScreensaver() async {
    let paperSaver = PaperSaver()

    do {
        // Check if Aerial is already active
        let activeScreensavers = paperSaver.getActiveScreensavers()
        let isAerialActive = activeScreensavers.contains("Aerial")

        if isAerialActive {
            print("‚úÖ Aerial screensaver is already active")
        } else {
            print("Setting Aerial screensaver...")
            try await paperSaver.setScreensaverEverywhere(module: "Aerial")
            print("‚úÖ Successfully set Aerial screensaver")
        }
    } catch PaperSaverError.screensaverNotFound {
        print("‚ùå Error: Aerial screensaver not found. Please install it first.")
    } catch {
        print("‚ùå Error setting screensaver: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}

// Usage in async context
await ensureAerialScreensaver()
```

### Setting Screensaver Idle Time

```swift
// Set screensaver to activate after 5 minutes of inactivity
try paperSaver.setIdleTime(seconds: 300)
```

### Listing Available Screensavers

```swift
let availableScreensavers = paperSaver.listAvailableScreensavers()
for screensaver in availableScreensavers {
    print("\(screensaver.name): \(screensaver.identifier)")
}
```

## macOS Version Compatibility

PaperSaver automatically detects the macOS version and uses the appropriate method for managing screensavers and wallpapers:

- **macOS Sonoma (14.0) and later**: Uses the new per-screen/space configuration system via `com.apple.wallpaper`
- **Pre-Sonoma versions**: Falls back to traditional `com.apple.screensaver` preferences and NSWorkspace APIs

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AerialScreensaver/PaperSaver.git
cd PaperSaver
swift build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
swift test
```

### Using the CLI Tool

The project includes a command-line interface for testing and development:

```bash
# Build and run the CLI
swift run papersaver --help

# List available screensavers
swift run papersaver list

# List spaces (macOS Sonoma+)
swift run papersaver list-spaces

# Set a screensaver
swift run papersaver set Aerial
```

### Current Development Focus

- Improving wallpaper management functionality
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation and examples
